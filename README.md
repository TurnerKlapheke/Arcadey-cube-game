## Project Overview

**Don't Hit Shit** is a 3D mobile arcade-style game developed in Unity that challenges players with obstacle navigation and precision timing mechanics. Built upon foundational concepts from Brackeys' ["How to make a Video Game in Unity"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) tutorial series, this project represents an expansion over the series through experimentation and iterative design.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Scoring System**:
  - Real-time performance metrics
  - SpeedRun timer
- **Difficulty Curve**: Progressive challenge scaling as levels progress
- **Visual Design**:
  - Clean geometric aesthetics

## Development Context

This project served as the technical component for an academic exploration titled _"The Human Cost of Game Development: Analyzing Crunch Culture Through Practical Implementation"_, authored during my sophomore year of high school. The development process was intentionally constrained to **48 hours** to simulate industry crunch conditions, providing first-hand insights into:

- Rapid prototyping methodologies
- Stress-testing creative problem solving
- Time management under artificial constraints
- Workflow optimization strategies

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Scripting**: C#
- **Physics**: Mix of Default Unity Values, and custom Collision System
- **Architecture**: Event-driven system communication

### Key Achievements
1. Self-taught C# proficiency through applied development
2. Acquisition of Game Design Principles
3. Building an installation wizard
